## <a name="prob"></a>Problem
In recent times, the rental market has become increasingly competitive because of the limited supply of available apartments. In fact, apartment occupancy reached a record high of 97.6% in the first quarter of 2022 (Ludden, 2022). Consequently, Ludden (2022) adds that the “asking rents for new leases were up 15.2% nationally”, in addition to many places experiencing significantly higher percentage increases. 

One of these impacted areas is college towns where students who have only known each other for a couple of months are forced to sign leases nearly a year in advance. At the University of Wisconsin-Madison, the already challenging apartment search was made more difficult by extreme rises in prices leaving a shortage of desirable and affordable properties. The scarcity of apartments pressured dozens of “UW-Madison students [to camp] out in line as early as 10 a.m. the day before to get one of their first-come, first-served leases”, as pictured below in Figure 1 (Wethal, 2022). One of these college students explains people’s decisions to skip class and job interviews, sharing that “How I pay for it is a later problem. I need to be focused on finding a place.” (Wethal, 2022).

The current rental environment has given landlords more unchecked control than ever before. With their newfound power, property owners are free to impose exploitative rental terms, subject renters to unfavorable conditions, and refuse tours of units. Therefore, prospective renters have limited and quickly disappearing resources to get honest information about their future homes.

## <a name="oss"></a>Open-Source Solution
In order to solve this serious problem, my project aims to provide an accessible and transparent open house and open-source experience to prospective renters through a website called Open Housing. The site allows current renters to contribute by posting genuine apartment reviews and photos. This allows renters to gain back power in the rental market by being able to view the true conditions of the apartment without being entirely dependent on property owners. Unlike the perfectly curated and styled photos on leasing company websites, Open Housing gives an authentic voice to the renters that actually live in the apartments. This insider information can help interested renters gain leverage in negotiations and combat competitive pricing by exposing the unpleasant and often hidden features of the apartment. In addition, current renters can benefit because apartment owners will be motivated to upgrade their living conditions in an effort to reduce negative reviews. All in all, Open Housing intends to foster a more equitable rental market by offering a platform for renters to speak about their experiences and reward property owners that deliver a quality living experience.

#### Open Housing Mockup

| :--: |
| <b>Figure 2</b>|   

The mockup, shown above in Figure 2, illustrates what the first version of the Open Housing website could look like for an apartment property. The leftmost part of the header includes the temporary Open Housing logo that serves as a button that can navigate visitors back to the home page that presents other apartments that might appeal to them. The remainder of the header is a specialized search bar that allows visitors to explore apartments that match their preferences for the number of bedrooms and bathrooms as well as the budget. A user can customize these search criteria through a drop-down menu for quick changes.

Below the header, is the apartment name in a large font followed by a visual of the number of the stars the building received for users to get a quick summary of the specific apartment they are looking at. In addition, this portion lists the average number of stars and the number of reviews that generated the score. In the darker pink box under this section, is the exact address of the property as well as other important information such as the number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, and the cost of rent and utilities. The inclusion of the price of monthly utilities separates Open Housing from many of the property-owned websites that attempt to conceal this expense to appear as an affordable living experience.

On the right-hand side is a paler pink box that exhibits some of the distinct features a prospective renter might be interested in for easy viewing. For instance, information about the company that owns the property, whether there are gym facilities, and if pets are welcome is displayed with corresponding icons.

The drop-down labeled “Unit Includes” lists all of the specific furniture and items that are included in the unit. Alongside specifying the size of the mattresses and the number of barstools, it provides particulars about less apparent features such as the sink garbage disposal. Many property-owned websites for college apartments will write that they are fully furnished, but neglect to itemize the exact details that are meaningful when preparing for apartment move-in day. For this section, contributors will be encouraged to think of the attributes that are not as obviously seen in photos.

Directly below these specifications is a sample of two renter reviews and the stars earned for the Johnstowne Apartments. The red text is an excerpt or summary that outlines the most important takeaway from the comment for efficient skimming. Notably, there are profiles for each of the contributors with the date it was posted and their badge level. These two factors cultivate a feeling of trust and merit in the reviews by knowing if it is recent and seeing that it is associated with a vetted community member.

Finally, the bottom right area is dedicated to images of apartments that are submitted by renters. This section aims to allow searchers to imagine themselves living in the space by seeing what it looks like when lived in. There is also a map of the surrounding area around the apartment for people to see what local businesses and shops are nearby. All in all, this section showcases the apartment in ways that can not be described with words alone. 

## <a name="pre"></a>Before Launch
The first step in project development is to establish a project timeline to outline the fundamental actions that must be completed before the release of Open Housing. Although the schedule is relatively flexible, it aims to provide a projection of the estimated time and order of operations for each task of the project. Since Open Housing is dependent on the collaboration of numerous individuals, certain components must be finished before advancing to the next. For instance, the domain name of the website must be secured before the apartment submission form can be posted to the website and shared with community members. In addition, the project timeline is useful in keeping collaborators on track and motivated by having a set goal release date. The time constraint also allows project managers to identify project steps that are progressing slowly to resolve issues before it causes a bottleneck. Furthermore, it enforces accountability for the team member responsible for this portion of the project.

After the project timeline is determined, the Open Housing website must be created. This serves as the main hub for community members to interact with the project and begin to make an impact in the rental market. Therefore, it is critical to establish an initial, functional website as soon as possible, so the rest of the platform can be built around it. The baseline website should include a landing page with a couple of mockups of apartment-specific pages. The details on the apartment-specific pages do not have to be accurate but should illustrate the different functionalities the website can have. In the future, web developers can advance these components by implementing search and other features. Additionally, a better user experience can be achieved by improving the aesthetics and ease of navigation of the site.

However, the most essential component that needs to be added to the website is the submission form. This apartment survey facilitates the collection of apartment information from reviews to the foundational details to originate an apartment-specific page. For instance, the apartment address, cost of monthly rent, and number of bedrooms must be gathered before an apartment page can be started. Beyond the standard measures, the form allows contributors to point out the distinct features of the apartment such as if there are gym facilities or an intercom system. Whenever possible, a drop-down menu should be available to make sure submissions are easy for community members and the results are consistent. In addition, the form must prioritize efficient photo upload as this is one of the standout features of Open Housing. The access to honest, unstaged photos of the living conditions sets it apart from property-owned websites and will drive users to the project.

Similar to many open-source projects, the most valuable stage before the project launch is community development. Although this step is constantly ongoing, it is imperative to engage with the community from early on to develop loyalty and support. After all, Open Housing is entirely dependent on renters submitting their photos and opinions of their homes. It is important to recognize that these are intimate spaces for individuals to share online. Therefore a community culture must be cultivated that makes people feel comfortable and safe uploading details about their apartments to the public. Additionally, community outreach can educate current renters about how they can gain agency in the rental market by participating in Open Housing. 

The first community that Open Housing aims to target is students at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. Through promotion in campus registered student organizations and social media advertising, and tabling an initial set of apartments can be assembled and the network can continue to grow. Since the origins of the Open Housing project will be set in the Champaign-Urbana area, it is integral to form meaningful relationships and connect with the neighborhood from the start.

## <a name="launch"></a>Project Launch
As a new project, it is imperative to spread awareness about Open Housing’s mission with members of its target audience. Therefore, a partnership with the Fall Housing Fair which is held annually on campus helps reach students in search of apartments for the next school year. The collaboration could be in the form of a booth that allows people to ask questions and familiarize themselves with the platform. Additionally, QR codes could be shared on flyers at the event to direct people straight to the website or social media platforms.

On the launch date, Open Housing can reward early contributors with housewarming gifts for their efforts in bringing the project to fruition. The packages can contain a small house succulent and a soft branded throw blanket that can be displayed in their living space. Moreover, the appreciation packages can continue to motivate the team past the launch into consistent growth for the future.

Although the in-person booth and gifts are significant, many interested people may miss or be unable to attend the events. Therefore, offering asynchronous opportunities to engage with the brand is valuable. For instance, recording people’s reactions to the booth and the thank you presents would be great ways to transform these experiences for asynchronous viewing. The footage can also be edited to produce social media content to boost engagement on the social platforms for Open Housing. The social media postings should convey the mission and benefits of the project to help visitors develop an affinity for the brand. Moreover, the videos and photos from the event can act as archives for new collaborators to learn about the brand story from the beginning. Lastly, a countdown to the launch of the website could be live-streamed for people to celebrate together as a community.

## <a name="community"></a>Community Engagement
As the project grows over time it is imperative that Open Housing continues to engage with community members. The project should aim to release a monthly newsletter to keep contributors informed about improvements and enhancements to the platform. Not only is this a great way to communicate updates to the team, but it acknowledges the work they do and reminds them that their efforts do not go unnoticed.

Another way to communicate appreciation to loyal contributors to the project is to award them with badges. This is only possible with built-in methods to measure collaborators’ impact which begins with creating an Open Housing account. Once the account is established the member’s actions can be tracked and a badge level can be assigned to the profile based on the quantity and frequency of contributions. The criteria needed for each of the four badge levels are presented in Table 1 below.

#### Badge Level Breakdown

| <b>Table 1</b>|  

On top of the recognition received with members’ earned badge levels, Open Housing should give back to the community through Open Housing events and specials. These experiences can be as simple as a table on the quad or a social media giveaway. Regardless of the form they take, they should speak to the core values of the brand and cultivate fellowship. In addition to thanking current contributors, these events can attract the attention of interested people and bring new members into the community.

Lastly, Open Housing should prioritize open channels to receive community feedback. These insights can be collected as a form or for more detailed suggestions through a town hall style discussion. After all, there is no better way to demonstrate that you care about your community than opening up the floor to their opinions. In many respects, the community members who interact with the website know more about the bugs and shortcomings than the developer. Therefore, it can only benefit Open Housing to value these voices and empower the community to share their thoughts.

## <a name="sustainability"></a>Sustainability
The Open Housing website will undoubtedly need continual work to remain updated and useful for prospective renters. One way to make project maintenance easier is to streamline the process to initialize and rate apartments. At its core, the ability to share opinions about apartments is the central idea behind Open Housing. Therefore, this aspect should constantly be evaluated to consider if there are better ways to simplify the procedures. The ultimate goal is for there to be no barriers for people to become contributors to the website and for every building to have representation on the site.

For Open Housing to intake all of the apartment entries, there needs to be an approved system to verify the postings are authentic and when applicable, accurate. As the site becomes more popular, it will be unreasonable for this task to be assigned to one person because it leaves a single point of failure. Therefore, it is important to establish an agile project workflow to delegate this responsibility to loyal members of the project. For instance, contributors with a badge level of either gold or platinum can have access to verify new apartment entries and monitor incoming reviews. This will allow the website to stay updated while upholding the quality of the content.

The Open Housing project should aim to develop multiple straightforward entry points for new community members to join. For individuals with programming experience, one suggested entrance to the project could be assisting in website modifications. There should be clear directions available on the website for interested programmers to be briefed on the website structure and interface. Similarly, for someone passionate about growing the community there should be steps about how to get involved in current outreach efforts made accessible for convenient contributions.

As Open Housing evolves, certain features will no longer be relevant to include on the website, and valuable functionalities will need to be incorporated. Regardless of if these components need to be added or removed, these changes should be welcomed to offer a positive user experience. For instance, eventually, it may no longer be pertinent to know whether parking is available. In that case, contributors should not be afraid of removing it from the top right corner pictured in Figure 2. On the other hand, as time goes on it may become critical to be able to search for apartments based on the distance from a particular campus building. Therefore, collaborators should feel supported to design this feature and introduce it to the community.

## <a name="proj-exp"></a>Project Expansions
Once the foundation is well-established, Open Housing can explore new avenues to expand the project. One opportunity for growth is through partnerships with apartment companies in the area. Similar to other search websites, property owners want their apartments to be listed as the first search result. This prominent position allows more people to gain awareness about the building which in turn increases the likelihood of them signing a lease. Open Housing can leverage this desire by awarding featured search placement in exchange for signing discounts for its members. This agreement would also benefit Open Housing because the rent savings will motivate more people to utilize the website during their apartment search.

Another potential partnership for Open Housing lies with the universities which are constantly striving to recruit top students to their schools. One of the major factors that these students consider when picking which university to attend is housing. In order to differentiate themselves from other institutions, a college can collaborate with Open Housing to promote the transparent housing practices available for students after dorm life. Prospective students and their parents can view the rental options through the website and feel confident in their living arrangements during their time at university.

Finally, Open Housing can scale the project beyond the initial headquarters of the Champaign-Urbana area. There are numerous cities, especially other college towns, that struggle with the competitive rental market and would benefit from the project entering their community. Despite the evident applications of Open Housing in these areas, each expansion needs to examine the location-specific features that may be decisive for those community members. For instance, in New York City, in-unit washers and dryers would be a meaningful feature to add since they do not come standard in buildings. Therefore, it is paramount to speak to residents of the community and learn about what is valuable to them before extending into the area. Only when the community is placed at the forefront will Open Housing be able to deliver the best possible experience. Ultimately, the project’s success is intrinsically tied to its connection with the community.
