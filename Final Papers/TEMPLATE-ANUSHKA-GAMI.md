# Introduction and Overview

For the community project, I wanted to plan out the implementation of an internship review platform for University of Illinois students. There are lots of platforms for students to share internship-related information such as Reddit, Discord, and Glassdoor. However, these platforms tend to be disorganized, confusing, and misleading. In particular, many UIUC students pursue internships at Research Park. A lot of the companies at Research Park are smaller and less established so finding information on internships at these companies can be an even bigger challenge. Internships are the primary pathway for students to figure out what they would like to do with their full-time careers. They are often a crucial element to a college student’s experience and allow students to get their foot in the door at companies. Getting your foot in the door is really difficult for most students–particularly those who do not have connections at companies they want to work for or industries they would like to work in. There is a lack of honest, clear information regarding the internship application and interview processes online.

On top of this, there is a lack of information regarding internship experiences themselves. Speaking from personal experience, many students have no idea what skills and knowledge they should have to make them competitive for internships–especially when they’re freshmen or sophomores. Internships are a key part of many students’ academic and professional career trajectories, providing them with opportunities to gain practical experience and develop skills in their chosen fields. This makes it especially shameful that there are a lot of misleading, confusing platforms with bad user experiences and information that students are forced to rely on during their search. In addition to this, the effectiveness and quality and internships themselves depend on numerous factors such as company culture, program design, and the nature of the work being completed by the intern. The primary goal of the UIUC internship review board is to provide a platform for UIUC students to share their experiences and feedback regarding internships. Students will be able to provide detailed reviews and ratings for their internships. There will be an authentication check with UIUC student emails to verify that the reviews are coming from real UIUC students. 

# Target Audience
The ideal target audience would all UIUC students–hailing from different backgrounds and majors as well as different levels of education. This platform ideally would be of value to undergraduates, masters, and PhD students. All three levels of study have numerous internship opportunities available to them. Furthermore, I would like this to be a platform for students across different majors ranging from the arts to social sciences to STEM and so on. I do not want this platform to be restricted to one type of student at the university. Oftentimes when I go to look into internship platforms online, there is a heavy focus on tech and finance internships and not much else. I did a preliminary survey among my friends to gauge their interest in such a platform. I found that STEM and business majors were the most interested in it whereas arts majors were less interested in it. Their disciplines tend to deal more with submissions to various magazines and papers to gain exposure and less to do with internships. However, they still said that this sort of platform would be of value to them. I asked students in creative writing specifically and they agreed that it would be useful for them to have knowledge of communication and marketing internships. Students across all majors would greatly benefit from	an internship review platform. The people I surveyed also mentioned how annoying it is to have to look across multiple platforms and websites scrambling to find relevant, helpful information. This review board would make the entire research process a lot simpler, and it would make it so that students could trust the information they see since it comes from fellow UIUC students. 

# Working Open and Licensing
There are many different concepts that have been discussed in class that would translate well into the project management of an internship review board. One of these concepts would be working open. Open-source software and tools can be highly useful for facilitating the development of an internship review board website. These tools have been made available for free use and modifications by anybody. Open source is especially great since different open-source platforms have communities of developers who are continuously improving the product. I could look into different open-source content management systems and freely available sources such as WordPress. WordPress is used by a lot of people to develop websites since it is so user-friendly and customizable. WordPress also allows someone to see how their website will look in real-time even as someone adds to, rearranges, or edits it. 
Other open-source platforms I would consider are Drupal and Joomla. Joomla in particular has around 8,000 extensions that can be used to add features to the website very efficiently and easily. In addition to this, we want our project to be open-access. This makes it so that our project has a degree of flexibility and stays participant-driven. This is a platform for UIUC students and it would be created by UIUC students. Instead of going down the route of using platforms such as WordPress, we could use HTML, React (which is a JavaScript library), and CSS to develop the website. There are a lot of tech-savvy students at UIUC who would be able to aid with programming. We would then make our code publicly available, allowing for anyone to look at it and modify it for their own purposes. They will be prohibited from modifying the main branch. The project will follow a regular schedule for small version updates, which will include bug fixes and feature enhancements. On the other hand, significant changes such as new features and compatibility improvements will be held off until appropriate milestones are achieved. The community members’ ability to modify the code will depend on a number of factors. The community members who have more contributions, highly significant contributions, and are actively engaged within the community will have greater abilities to modify the code. This reward-based approach encourages community members to remain committed to the project and strive to make meaningful contributions. Although this may seem counterproductive at first glance, it serves as a reliable measure of community member commitment, trustworthiness, and accountability. This makes it so newcomers have role models to become inspired by. 
In class, we discussed the importance of social capital while working open. Trust, positivity, altruism, and innovation are all key pillars of working on open-source projects. In addition to these, transparency is a key value in our project, and we believe that an open project will lead to a better product. We will have full commitment to being transparent with the versions we release and the decisions we make. We also want to ensure that we listen to community feedback and integrate it into our work. Our users are the ones who drive our project. Without them, our project would not exist nor would it have any purpose. We want to serve them first and foremost. While there are so many benefits to working open, there are drawbacks and risks that we must pay attention to. Openness can lead to code theft, hacking, and a slew of security concerns. To combat this, we have selected individuals responsible for implementing and keeping up with new security measures to ensure both project and user safety. Unfortunately, we cannot make security protocols shareable as they may pose a significant risk to those using the software. 
Additionally, we will establish licenses to best prevent code theft. There were a few key licenses I looked into that would suit the purposes of the project. The Apache and MIT licenses are the two I was drawn to. For the purposes of this student project, I would prefer using the MIT license since the Apache one has certain complex legal terminology and the MIT one is much more straightforward. This would make it more enticing for people to come on board the project. In addition to being more straightforward, it has solid protection and does not impose any significant restrictions on how the software can be used. Another advantage of the MIT License is that it provides clear liability and warranty disclaimers, which can help to protect the software's original authors from legal claims that may arise from the use or distribution of the software.

# Using GitHub
Another tool that we want to utilize is GitHub. GitHub is a popular web-based software platform used for version control and collaboration on various projects. GitHub is commonly used by developers across the world since it makes communication and collaboration extremely easy. Coding projects can get complicated and messy fairly quickly so it is always good to rely on a platform that helps keep the project organized, on track, and moving in the right direction. One of GitHub’s key features is its issue management system. As discussed in class, the issue management system is used to track and manage tasks and bugs involved with the project. We can categorize the different issues based on their urgency and type. GitHub makes this all extremely organized, and we can also assign issues to different members of the team. These issues can also be integrated with different platforms such as Slack and Trello, ensuring that assignees can receive notifications and updates regarding their relevant issues. Also, GitHub issue management allows for tag and milestone labels to ensure everyone is aware of how the issues are being handled. Here is an example of an issues board:
## Figure 3: GitHub Issue Board
<img width="1336" alt="Screen Shot 2023-05-09 at 2 02 14 PM" src="https://github.com/OREL-group/Project-Management/assets/55010452/4a09fab9-212b-408c-8dbd-f0df20b19677">
As we can see, we are able to label each issue by urgency. This is a Kanban-style board that enables teams to visualize and manage their workflow in a highly collaborative way. When using an issue board, each task or issue is represented by a card that contains relevant information such as the title, description, assignee, labels, due date, and other metadata. As we click on each issue, we are able to see its own individual relevant pieces of information as well. On top of this, we can move around the different issues to different columns as well. This is extremely useful since it leaves no room for confusion or ambiguity since the issues are so organized and easy to understand. Without an issue board, it would be more difficult to facilitate collaboration and transparency within our project. Team members are able to see who is working on which elements and what still needs to be done. This prevents duplicated efforts and reduces confusion.  Overall, this issue review board is such a key element in helping drive our project forward.

# Community Events
Another important element of the development of a project involves creating community involvement. This makes it so that everyone feels involved, invested, and interested in driving the project forward. Without adequate community involvement, the project faces a major risk of staying stagnant. Community events and community involvement are critical to the success of software projects, as they can help to foster a sense of ownership and engagement among users, developers, and other stakeholders. When users feel invested in a software project, they are more likely to provide feedback, report bugs, and contribute to the development process in meaningful ways. Community events bring together all sorts of people involved in the project including users, developers, and donors. All of these groups have a common interest in the project and want to contribute to its success. I have numerous ideas for what types of events I would want to implement including hackathons, conferences, giveaways, online gaming events, zoom events, and forums. In terms of online events, I could host workshops and webinars that provide information on how to look for and evaluate internships. I could invite student guest speakers who have used the platform to talk about their experiences with it as well as their actual internship experience itself. I think it would be good to invite some seniors to speak to underclassmen. When I was a freshman, I did not know how to effectively search for internships so I wish another student was there to show me the ropes. 
On top of this, I would want to attend events where I could promote my platform and recruit new users and developers for it. I could attend local or regional internship and career fairs to show off my project. I can set up a booth, hand out promotional material, and collect live feedback on what students would like to see added to the platform. I also think hosting a Hackathon where I have some corporate-sponsored giveaways would be a great way to get people actively involved in the project and working on projects of their own. There could be free swag given out to all of the Hackathon attendees, and there could be prizes such as gift cards, tablets, and devices given away to the top winners in each category. In general, there are a lot of events I have in mind. These events would definitely be able to draw a huge student crowd which is my goal as this is my target audience. 

# Implementation
In terms of implementation, there are a lot of tools and technologies I could use to develop a project like this. Because I already have the goals in mind for the internship review board, my next step would be to look into current existing projects of a similar nature. This would help me identify best practices as well as potential challenges. I could also look to these resources to determine which tech stack would work out the best for such a project. As of right now, I am leaning towards using React, CSS, and HTML to develop this platform. I also have considered the framework Flask as well since it integrates well with Python, and because Python is the language I have the most familiarity with. I also feel as though using Google Cloud Platform for the backend services would be a great idea since I will want to be able to manage a relational database system that stores all of the review information. I will of course use GitHub to manage the source code and track changes made by developers in the project. Version control allows me to manage things such as merging, branching, and commit history tracking to see how the project is currently progressing. We also want to test our platform as we go. Testing frameworks like Selenium, Pytest, or Mocha can be used to automate the testing of the website's functionality and performance. They can provide tools for unit testing, integration testing, and end-to-end testing. Finally, we want to use a platform or two that will allow us to look into website metrics and evaluate the success of the website. A platform like Google Analytics allows us to track user behavior, website traffic, and performance metrics. All of these tools facilitate the use of the Agile methodology which involves adaptive planning, continual development, as well as flexible responses to feedback.

# Sustainability and Conclusion
I want to ensure that the UIUC internship review board will be sustainable and that it will have continuous turnover as people graduate. This is part of the reason why community involvement is so important. Building a community of users and supporters can help ensure the longevity of the project, and it is very easy to engage users and developers in social activities pertaining to the development of the project. Furthermore, making the project open source lends itself to a sustainable platform. Even as the original developers move on, the project will remain developed and maintained over time. People will be able to continuously develop and build the project based on suggestions from the community which is the main purpose of this platform. Another key aspect of sustainability would be forming partnerships with other organizations or companies to help provide resources and support for the project. This is also beneficial because it can help us expand our reach to new audiences. We could also partner with resident student organizations on campus to expand our reach and find new collaborators. 
In conclusion, the development of a UIUC student-run internship review board would represent a significant step forward in improving the internship search and work experience for student across campus. By providing a platform for sharing honest and constructive feedback, students will be able to seek out positive and fulfilling work environments for their internship experiences. It also makes it so that students can make informed decisions about their career paths.  The use of open-source technologies and collaboration with the community will ensure the continued growth and improvement of the platform, while its sustainable business model will ensure its longevity.
