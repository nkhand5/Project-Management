### Introduction    
CourseChat is an open-source application designed to facilitate group chats for university students. The application provides pre-built group chats for every course offered at the university. At the beginning of each semester, students can upload their course information and university details, and the application will automatically add them to two different group chats.

The first group chat is specific to their course and university, where they can communicate with their classmates and discuss course-related topics. The second group chat is for students in similar courses across different universities, allowing them to connect with peers from different institutions and gain a broader perspective on their field of study.

Although the application is primarily designed for university students, anyone can access and join the group chats, regardless of their profession. The public nature of the chats allows anyone to ask or answer questions and engage with others on a wide range of topics related to the course material.

#### Public Post
In addition to CourseChat, the application also includes a feature called Public Post. Public Post allows users to upload any style of question, and other users can provide different solutions to the problem. This feature provides an open platform for people to share their ideas and perspectives on a wide range of topics beyond just their courses.

### Purpose
In the current educational system, there is a lack of universal applications that allow students to share their questions and ideas with others in a collaborative and organized manner. Different courses and institutions use various platforms, such as Discord, Github, or Piazza, to facilitate communication among students. However, while these options can be effective in their own ways, they do not provide a comprehensive solution for students to discuss and aid each other with understanding complex topics.

One of the significant limitations of using different platforms for different courses is that it can become confusing for students to keep track of their various conversations and resources. For example, a student may have to check multiple platforms to find answers to their questions, which can be time-consuming and frustrating. Moreover, different platforms have different features, making it difficult to have a consistent experience across courses.

Furthermore, some platforms may not be designed explicitly for educational purposes, leading to potential security concerns and limitations in their functionality. For instance, while Discord is a popular platform for communication among gamers, its suitability for educational purposes is limited, and it may not provide features that are essential for academic collaboration, such as document sharing, file storage, and task management.

A universal application that provides pre-built group chats for every course, such as CourseChat, can help to alleviate these challenges. By centralizing communication and collaboration, students can easily access information and resources, stay organized, and engage in meaningful discussions with their peers. Such a platform could also offer features specifically designed for educational purposes, such as integration with learning management systems, real-time collaboration tools, and secure access control.

### Target Audience

The idea for CourseChat, the open-source application that provides pre-built group chats for every course, was originally created with the intention of benefiting students in the Information School (iSchool) and those taking Engineering courses, specifically Computer Science courses.

The iSchool and Engineering courses typically involve complex topics that require extensive collaboration and discussion among students. However, traditional methods of communication, such as email or in-person discussions, can be inefficient and challenging to manage, particularly for larger groups of students. Therefore, there was a need for a platform that could provide a centralized location for students to communicate and collaborate with one another.

Moreover, Computer Science courses, in particular, involve working on complex coding projects that require collaboration and a high degree of precision. Having a platform like CourseChat that provides a centralized location for students to communicate and collaborate can greatly enhance their productivity and effectiveness.
