## Open Source Game Development
EJ Demas, IS 340 Spring 2023

## Abstract
In this paper I will be talking about the benefits of using open source project management. Specifically, I will be showing how to implement open source in the process of creating a video game and how open source creates many benefits in indie game development and the video game industry. The paper will explore the many aspects of video game development and how they all can use and take advantage of open source management. I will be using the topics discussed in Dr. Bradly Alicea’s lectures from Information Science 340 Project Management and other online resources. 

## Introduction 
Dr. Alicea defines open source as computer software where the “original source code is made freely available and may be redistributed and modified”. Open source project management has become more common in recent years because of its customization, community support and many other benefits. A big example of an open source project is the Firefox web browser. Since it uses an open source license it has allowed a community of developers to support and contribute improvements making it a very popular web browser. Some benefits of Firefox being open source is its transparency, security, and collaboration. With code being open to review by developers and the public, it adds a layer of transparency and security to users because it ensures the software is free hidden features and harmful code. 

Open source is becoming more and more common in the video game industry. A strong gaming community already exists and open source software is beginning to bridge the game development community with the gaming community. This is creating even “more attention on community” and an “overall evolution towards community” (Brasseur). Gamers are more attracted to games that have a big community and this new change in them getting to be a part of the development of their games is creating a whole new aspect to the community. There are many aspects that are vital to open-source game development that I will discuss in this paper. Two worth highlighting are the game engine and licenses. A game engine is a framework that is used to actually create a video game. It is very important that I choose a game engine that allows and supports open source projects, a good example being the game engine Unity. Open source licensees are very important to this process. They will legally lay out what software and sections of the game can be viewed, distributed, and modified. Throughout this paper I will discuss these in more detail and the other most important factors of open source indie game development.  

## Purpose 
The purpose of my project is to create a solo developed video game using open source software so that I can have access to more resources and receive support from other game developers. Playing video games has always been a passion of mine and I have recently gained an interest in the process of making a video game. After some research and Dr. Alicea’s class I know that I want to manage this project by taking advantage of open source resources. My end goal is to have a game that is cross-platform for all consoles, pcs and mobile devices and by using open source software this goal is much more achievable. However, there is a lot of planning and management that needs to be done first. I will first research what type of game I want to make, if it should be 2D or 3D, what game engine I want to use, and what software I would use to make the game art and music. Since this is my first game, I am making I will most likely create a 2D pixel art video game as it is a simpler option than 3D video game development. By using open source software, I will be able to add more customization to my game and have access to my game. I am committed to using open source software throughout the development of my video game and I'm very excited to gain experience becoming a game developer. I believe that taking advantage of open source resources will not only be beneficial to my own game but will also contribute to the community of indie game developers who share the same passions as I do. 

## Target Audience
The target audience for my video game is in general the video game community; specifically indie gamers. These are people who play video games and especially games that are created by independent developers and small studios. I will most likely start with one specific console and focus on that gaming community first to get feedback. I am most familiar with Xbox games and the Xbox community so I will start there. Since the game is going to be made using open source software, gamers will have access to the code and can create their own modifications and customizations and provide me with feedback. Xbox gamers might not have previous coding and game development experience, so I will research an open source software that is specifically known for its user-friendly interface, easy customizable changes, and easy to learn.  

## Game Engine and License
 After doing research about which game engines are best to use for open source game development, I’ve decided that Unity is the best option for my game. Unity is known for its cross-platform capabilities and flexibility with customizations. It includes an AssetStore where developers can post their assets that they created for other game developers to use in their game. They can post their 2D and 3D art, code, and plugins so they are available for all other unity developers. This creates an even more sense of community because it allows developers to easily share and post their work for all other developers to see.

Unity also provides its developer with licenses and multiple options as well. I will be using Unity Personal because it free and you get to “own the content you create” (Unity). After some time developing and getting my game more polished, I will upgrade to Unity Pro so that I can publish my game on platforms “such as Nintendo Switch, Sony PlayStation, Google Stadia, and Microsoft Xbox” (Unity).  I will also use a third-party license to ensure total security and ownership of my work. I will use GNU General Public License (GPL). It will require that anyone else who uses my original work be licensed under the same license so that all work is available to everyone. It also allows for users to redistribute mine and their work as long as it is done under the terms and conditions of the GPL. By combining the Unity license and the GPL I will be able to create an open source game that takes advantage of the Unity Community and the GPL to help me incorporate all of them in the gaming and game development community.  <img width="725" alt="Screenshot 2023-05-02 at 6 05 54 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89623158/235803920-1ecd6695-442f-4f3e-9aef-37bd708dbbd2.png">

## Code Access
I will use Git-hub to store my code so that it can be open source and publicly shared. I will have a repository that will store all the code files for my video game. This repository will be part of my GNU General Public License so that people who view, distribute, and modify my code must follow the terms of the license. GitHub also has some open source features that I will take advantage of. I am not going to allow everyone to be able to make changes to the main git repository. After making connections in the indie game development community, I will allow people I choose to be able to fork their code changes and modifications but will make all forks need to be approved by me. I will probably also try to implement some sort of a system with game users/testers where they can submit their code changes and recommendations via GitHub so that I can see their feedback and what specific changes they want to see in the code.  

The video game is going to need lots of updates to fix bugs and add new features. GitHub will allow me to easily manage new versions of code and make updates to the code. By being able to easily see people’s feedback and code changes I will be able more easily find and fix bugs and add features that the community wants. Developers can add features and make code changes and then submit their requests to GitHub. Overall GitHub is really the foundation to making this project open source. It allows me to publicly share my code and allow others to view, download and mess around with my code.

## Community 
As I said before, there is already a giant gaming and indie game development community. I plan to take full advantage of this for my project by building connections and getting help from others with the same passions as me. For example, I plan on joining multiple sub reddits to join the community. There is already a big reddit group specifically for indie game developers and I plan on becoming an active member of this community. I also plan on creating a subreddit for my game where I can share information and communicate with people interested in playing the game. Here I can also share the links to my GitHub and share videos of gameplay. Reddit is a great resource to create an online community and share content. I believe that here I can find other developers that will want to help support my game and can teach me more about the process of making a video game.

## Code Language 
My goal is to create the entire project in C++ code. I have experience working with C++ and it is the most common language for game development. Selecting a single code language to use will create a less hectic project with less confusion. C++ allows for cross-platform communication which is what I want for my video. C++ is the standard for most video games and very compatible with the Unity game engine. It is safe to say that more people in the game development community will feel more comfortable helping with this project and be able to answer questions I have with code if it is in C++. 

## Conclusion 
In conclusion, I’ve always had a passion for playing video games and programming. I’m excited to merge these two connections into a new passion for game development. After taking Information Science 340 with Dr. Bradly Alicea, I know that managing this project with open source software and resources is the best option. I will use the game engine Unity that supports open source collaboration with other game developers. I will protect and allow for the distribution of my code, game art, and intellectual property with the GNU General Public License and Unity Personal. Lastly, I will use GitHub to store and host my C++ code files so that they are able to be viewed and downloaded by others. By using open source resources, I will be able to get help from other developers, receive feedback, and overall create the best version of this project. In summary, I believe that this project will be successful because of the benefits of using open source resources and software. From selecting GNU General Public License, Unity, Unity Personal, and GitHub I will be able to share this project with the other developers and receive help and advice. My code, game art, and intellectual property are all going to be protected and able to be viewed, distributed and modified. I’m very excited for this journey of creating my own video game and using open source software and resources to support my project.
