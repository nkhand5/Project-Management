### Abstract

In this paper, I will be describing my surfing database named BigZ, and its benefits both for the surfing community, and the general infrastructure and technology that will be deployed to build and maintain the database (BigZ). The goal of this paper is to establish the learning that I attained through lecture and discussion with Dr. Bradley Alicea during his teaching of IS340 Product Management by applying his lessons and our ideas to a project of our own design. 

### Introduction
Currently, the surfing community and the public-at-large have access to surfing information through 3 means, physical sighing (being present at a surf spot and viewing the conditions), word-of-mouth, and online presence that contains information from estimated or forecasted wave sightings. BigZ’s purpose is to combine these three attributes into a fast, easy to use, and accessible database and website that is available to all. One example of a popular surfing website is Surfline, which is a for-profit website that aims to share daily surfing information to those who are interested. Surfline’s business model currently has a pay scale model meaning that users pay for features and access on a monthly basis. The basic and free plans allow online users to only view daily information that is updated through forecasts. Paid users get access to live camera feeds of surfing locations, however the This is a similar result that BigZ aims to emulate, however the execution and implementation will be much different. BigZ will be an open-source database and website that aims to have a significant percentage of the project code available on a public repository such as Github. The reason for making this surfing database open-source is to increase the usefulness of the database for the online coding community as it gives experience to those who are not familiar with code bases more time to work, removes deadlines, and generates goodwill and transparency with the work that the community is doing. Additionally, a community of creators working together can help build competition and increase productivity in the results that the codebase receives. 

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to create a surfing database that is called to from a website for up to the minute accuracy, and a mobile application that will be used for quick, and easy to understand information. There is currently a lack of historical information online about surfing spots, and my plan is to focus on the Northern California region for surfing as there are already many historical sources available to provide historical surfing information, as well as the Northern California region containing some of the world’s best surfing spots. The reason for this is because there is already a large amount of data available, it is centered in one geographic location, and there are several websites that exist that provide some surfing information daily, which gives my project a good baseline. The appeal of this surfing database (BigZ), is the free access and open source nature of the project. Other competitors such as Surfline rely on paywalls and frequently inaccurate information and forecasting to display online, and as a result there is little trust between the community and what is told to them. At first, the focus will be on building up a historical database that one can look back on either through the website, or through the mobile application, and both the website and mobile app will call back to the database. Next, because BigZ will first focus on Northern California surfing spots, the aim will be to provide accurate, up-to-date information on the surfing spots, such as wave height, wind direction, break area, and temperature, all of which helps provide the community with the most accurate and useful information. 

### Target Audience 
Our ideal target audience would start as the local surfing communities in Northern California, in addition to tourists, and the local’s who are interested in surfing. Once these communities have been penetrated, we will expand BigZ’s network to the rest of California. For these audiences, the requirements are relatively the same, however wave and surf conditions change by the minute, so we will have to adjust updates accordingly in order to meet our mission of accurate, and updated information. This project will be very customizable as we want those in the open source community to work on the project and keep themselves involved by using our code base for their own separate projects. For this project we have two target audiences, we want to attract surfers and their communities to use the app and website. This is our public and primary audience as their usage will drive traffic and money towards our services. The second community is our open source community who actually build and develop our services. This community, while not as open or as public, is just as important as our users. We want to implement a way of including all into the community, going from those who have a lot of experience with building and deploying code, to those with little to no experience as we believe that building a community of hope is far more beneficial than implementing a ranking system or a payments scheme. Something that will attract users to our services will be the difference in the user experience to our competitors. We plan to be built as a free service to enter the market and expand in order to increase market share before becoming profitable. We want to conquer each market that we enter, and we will implement a better and faster user experience by highly developing any product that is launched in order to prioritize user experience over having an abundance of features.  


### Implementation
We will continually update our website and host it on github pages while being protected by Cloudflare, which is a Content Delivery Network (CDN), which will allow our users to gain access to our open-source code while still being protected from scrapers and those with bad intent. The database will be in mySQL, while we use a Cloudflare worker to pass the data and tokenize it before returning it back to the website or mobile app. This will reduce load time as we can store some data on a user’s local device to allow for faster information and a better user experience. BigZ’s base will be publicly available as an open source community with it’s resources available for individual use. This is because the successful stewardship of open resources can provide many of the necessary components to make the platform both relevant and useful as more and more contributors join over time. These same contributors can keep BigZ relevant as the needs of technology and social needs change with the times, however a sustainable effort will look like a continued growth of users as BigZ’s size and scope change accordingly. There will be several README files that detail in-depth the community standards that BigZ contributors should adhere to, and to be transparent in all actions and updates that are made to the platform. This allows several features of an open source community to be implemented, maintaining project scope, shared workload (power of community), documentation of process, and community events. When successfully implemented, community involvement in the buildup of BigZ will hopefully be able to be sustained and increased at a rapid pace, while being able to avoid burnout and overreliance on key members. In order to manage features and maintain resources on features and issues that require immediate attention, careful and dedicated resource management will guide every step of the process. Each feature will be carefully defined and the scope will be defined by a work breakdown structure, in which we have a detailed breakdown of the feature and how it is implemented and integrated into the overall project design. As projecttimes.com [1] stated, there should be a defined process for capturing and distributing requirements. Each feature and it’s breakdown structure will be publicly available for the community to better understand the direction that members are headed in. This benefits all in the community, as over time the needs of the community will change, in addition to changes in technology, philosophy of design, and the number of resources required. According to opensource.guide [2]. “Documentation not only clarifies your own thinking, but it helps other people understand what you need or expect, before they even ask. [...] Having a clear, documented vision keeps you focused and helps you avoid “scope creep” from others’ contributions.” As BigZ grows, the owners of the project will spend less time coding and more time managing or defining issues. This is only natural and we want to shepherd resources in the most efficient way possible, emphasizing growth and user involvement over anything else. 

### License:
For BigZ’s code license, we have chosen the FPA General Code License, which is a license that is oriented towards an open source style coding base. The FPA license [3] “permits the use, modification, and distribution of code for personal and educational purposes. It also prohibits companies from using the code commercially without significant modification.“ This has several benefits for BigZ, it allows individual users to freely download and modify our code base to improve and sandbox the code, while preventing commercial entities from reusing our community’s work for profit. 

### Community Engagement 
Because BigZ will exist in a wholly online community and presence, software versioning will be extremely important both for documentation and transparency. We will implement Semantic Versioning to prepare the community for any changes that are made to the platform, in addition to standardizing releases in a timely and understandable manner. Additionally, we want to increase community engagement as much as possible. We plan to implement two major pathways in which ideas can be gestated. Feedback boards and discussion forums paired with user ideas will lead to community engagement as the community will see developers and the community working together to produce a better product. Secondly, with each new release and iteration, we plan to incorporate these releases into a Discorse model, in which high contributing users will be rewarded with higher and higher rankings, while those users with low contribution or poor quality work will not gain any rankings. In order to rank users, a higher quantity of work will not be rewarded so as to prevent spam, while the quality of work will be reviewed by other high ranked community members and high marks from these reviews will result in higher ranking. This is for two reasons, with higher ranking comes more features and access to the code base, and to increase competition within the community. If more developers are incentivized to gain access they will try and submit the best work possible and to additionally gain more access than their “competitors''. This system emphasizes quality work and increases community engagement with their developers. We want to combine this system with another method of access: Community Events. 

### Community Events

#### Town Halls
The first method of accessing BigZ and its related code is through developing and being involved within the community. However, the second method that we want to introduce are community events that increase participation from developers who are not always actively involved in the community. These events would take the form of weekly or monthly town hall meetings, in an environment like Zoom or in a kind of participation style format hosted on Discord or Slack. We want to be as open and as collaborative as possible, so we will not filter or moderate questions that the community poses. Community town hall meetings serve as a sort of pressure release, allowing for any concerns or grievances to be aired before they become an issue. This protects the transparency of BigZ, and allows everyone to be in the same mindset as the project and community change. While high ranking members of the community are expected to contribute, they are also meant to take the concerns of any involved and to find a resolution. Something that we anticipate will change is the scale of these events, as the community expands and a solution such as an open town hall style meeting becomes untenable due to size or time constraints, we plan to allow only high ranking community members to pose and answer questions, expecting that they will act in the best interest of the community. While we will discuss and answer issues, it is expected that any large scale changes to the code base will be decided on by high ranking members and not by a general consensus and vote. This is for two reasons, high ranking members should have more experience and access and are therefore in a better position to know what direction BigZ should take, and we want to stick to timelines and a master plan first before deviating from the course. 

#### Special Events
Special Events will take the form of Hackathons, Decathons, and Ideathons all of which serve different purposes. While we do have a main community that builds out features, we believe that a strong diversity of thought is important to maintain relevance and to keep fresh ideas and beliefs in the organization. A Hackathon is defined by techtarget.com [4]  as a “ social coding event that brings computer programmers and other interested people together to improve upon or build a new software program.” We want to host at least one Hackathon a year and to build teams from entrants both from within the community and externally. We will segregate teams based on whether they have been involved with BigZ previously so as to not mix external and internal personnel. This is because we believe that if we mixed BigZ community members with those coming in from the outside, new and fresh ideas might be tainted by what previous BigZ members believe in from their experience. We want to be generating as many new ideas and members as possible from each special event, and building an external community that is invested in the success of the project is integral. A Decathon is defined by the Berkeley Institute for Data Science [5] as a “[...] one-week long coding sprint that aims to motivate open source developers to spend less time building new features and squashing bugs and more time creating examples, tutorials, API descriptions, and guides to help their users learn more about their projects.” Decathons build documentation, while Hackathons aim to build features and code. Both benefit the system, but in different ways. We plan to host Decathons twice a year compared to Hackathons once a year. This is because the amount of code produced during a year far outstrips the code produced during a Hackathon. Investing time and effort into producing quality documentation during a Decathon builds in accessibility, and provides an entry point for those interested in joining the community. 

### Sustainability

The database will be entirely in mySQL, as it is a common language that is widely taught in college classrooms in addition to there being many free tutorials and classes online. However, the majority of our code base will be in Python because it is an accessible, easily taught language that a vast majority of developers will have some experience with, and therefore is an easy choice to make. Additionally, a maintainer will do frequent reviews so as to ensure that our code is relevant, and we are not relying on antiquated practices in our operation. As we plan to implement strict community standards and code reviews, we see the maintainer as a last line of defense in protecting the quality of our code base. Documentation and transparency are the best practices for implementing quality work and code and ensuring that BigZ’s growth is healthy and at a sustainable pace.
