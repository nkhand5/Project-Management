## Publishing your final papers.

To publish your final paper, be sure to refresh your repository fork, then fill in the TEMPLATE.md file in your forked repository (like we did in Quiz 1). __NOTE:__ use the template file in your updated fork and then issue a pull request as you did in Quiz 1. Follow the instruction as provided in the template Markdown code and comments. Click on the "raw" button to see the comments and Markdown code. You can create a Github issue to store your images at a stable URL (upload the image into the body of the issue, then copy the URL from the text of the issue), or upload them to the [Final Papers](https://github.com/OREL-group/Project-Management/blob/main/Final%20Papers/) directory. 

Test out formatting of the assignment as you did in Quiz 1. Once completed (and before you commit changes), change the name of TEMPLATE.md to TEMPLATE-FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME.md (where your name replaces first, last example) and issue a pull request to the main repository. Please also send along a .pdf version of your Word document to my [e-mail address](mailto:balicea@illinois.edu).

Papers should be pushed to the OREL-group Github repository by May 11 by the 11:59pm in Champaign-Urbana (UTC -5). [Let me know](mailto:balicea@illinois.edu) if you have any questions.
